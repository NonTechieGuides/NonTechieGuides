I'm a non-dev learning about the JAMStack, static sites, React, Sanity, NextJS, etc., for my own endeavors. in my real life, I'm a writer and publisher.

This repo will be a step-by-step walkthrough of how I am building my websites to be modern, cutting edge, performant, and best practice to give my users the best possible experience.

If you're a non-techie, like me, but want to learn more about this amazing tech, then follow my blog at nontechieguides.io/blog. And subscribe to my newsletter (I'll have some cool free stuff for you to download soon as my thanks!) at nontechieguides.io/newsletter. 

And watch for a book designed to help you build an awesome website ... THE NON-TECHIE'S GUIDE TO THE JAMSTACK ... coming in January 2022.
